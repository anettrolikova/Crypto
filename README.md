- "Phase 0 is the beacon chain, which implements the Proof of Stake protocol, an alternative to Proof of Work for securing the blockchain network. Phase 1 provides massive scalability in the form of shard chains, increasing the transaction handling capacity of the network by over a thousand. Phase 2 is the execution layer that will provide user accounts and smart contracts, and support the full array of distributed applications necessary for our decentralised future." 
"the beacon chain will start up in early 2020. A date of January 3rd has been suggested, being the anniversary of the Bitcoin genesis block. But that is perhaps too soon to be completely production ready. A little later in Q1 2020 is most likely."
